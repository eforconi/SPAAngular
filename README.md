# KiteApp

This is a personal project to showcase my portfolio and an idea that interests me, as I love kitesurfing. It is a Single Page Application (SPA) designed to help people who are starting their journey in kitesurfing find their kite instructor.

The website will provide a list of kite instructors registered at your location, along with their experience, disciplines, prices, equipment, and qualifications, as well as their ratings.

Another user type will be the kite instructor, who can create and manage their profile and services.

An expansion for this project could include two additional views: one for tourist services, such as kite trips or specialized clinics focused on a particular kite discipline, and the other a marketplace for buying and selling kite equipment.
